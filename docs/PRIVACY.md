# Privacy Policy for SunoMate

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025

## Data Collection

SunoMate does **NOT** collect, store, or transmit any personal user data to our servers.

## What the Extension Does

- **Local Processing**: All artist name replacements happen locally in your browser
- **API Data**: Fetches a public database of artist-to-style mappings from our server (no user data sent)
- **Local Storage**: Preferences and optional API keys are stored only on your device using Chrome's local storage
- **Third-Party AI**: If you use the AI style generation feature, prompts are sent directly to your chosen provider (Google, Anthropic, or OpenAI) - not to us

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- Personal information (name, email, etc.)
- Browsing history
- User activity or behavior
- Financial information
- Location data
- Website content you create

## Permissions Explained

- **suno.com, app.suno.ai**: Required to modify the styles field on the Suno website
- **suno.up.railway.app**: To fetch the artist-to-style database
- **Storage**: To save your preferences (toggle state, API keys) locally on your device only

## Third-Party Services

When you use the optional AI generation feature:
- Prompts are sent directly to the AI provider you select (Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, or OpenAI GPT)
- These providers have their own privacy policies
- Your API keys are stored locally and only transmitted to the provider you choose

## Data Security

Since we don't collect data, there's nothing to secure on our end. Your preferences and API keys are stored locally using Chrome's secure storage API.

## Changes to This Policy

We will update this policy if our data practices change. The "Last Updated" date will reflect any modifications.
